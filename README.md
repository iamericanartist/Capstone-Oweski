## PROPOSAL
### OweSki - “...so you KnowSki”
When two people go to lunch, get beers, buy a soda, etc., and one of the people buys and says “you get the next one”: OweSki is a way for both parties to track who owes whom. 
### OweSki Snapshot
OweSki is basically a “who’s turn is it?” tracker. 
Someone bought lunch? +1 to buyer / -1 to beneficiary

### NOTES
- OweSki is an idea I’ve had for a while now. A best friend and I have had a “mental” OweSki going for a while, and I’ve always intended to make it an application at some point; why not now?
- I see this as a phone app eventually, but functionally it could/should work just as well as a web app (make it responsive!)
